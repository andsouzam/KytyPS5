// views checked against the images over their own range rather than the whole image set),

// generations kept while the whole image set is unchanged), budgetcache (VMA's memory budget
// fetched from the driver at most every 500 ms), specspin (the draw speculation thread spinning
// for a restart before sleeping), speclead (draws within SpeculationLead of the GPU thread left to
// it), specreads (a speculation's guest reads kept without making them again while its BDA epoch
// lasts and nothing became GPU-written), exactwrite (a buffer write over exactly one image's
// range leaving the images it only partly overlaps as they were), viewmemo (a resolved texture
// binding starting from the view its description's last binding acquired), imagegroups (a stage
// repeating its program and image descriptors keeping its last images and views), nullreuse (a
// null texture binding keeping its image and view while its descriptor repeats), imagebuf (a
// repeatedly re-uploaded CPU-written image range held in a buffer, copying only written pages),
